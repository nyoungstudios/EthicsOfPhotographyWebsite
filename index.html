         <p>A photograph is a very popular medium of capturing a moment in time or expressing a certain feeling. In today’s digital world, so many different people have access to cameras, and it becomes hard for a photographer to differentiate him or herself from the crowd. One of the ways photographers try to make their photos unique is by post-processing (or editing) their photos through photo editing software. Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom have become the staple for photo editing software ever since their release, and they are still the most widely used pieces of photo editing software. With these powerful tools at the hands of so many photographers today, it has helped many photographers refine their photos to their style and to look the best. However, this brings up many issues and ethical questions about the use of post-processing in photography. So, how much editing can be done to a photo to still be considered a photo opposed to a fake one?</p>
         <p>&nbsp;This issue of post-processing a photo has its origins way before the digital age of photography. It can be traced back to days of film photography. Although film photography was not the first type of photography invented, it was the first time that processing a photo was introduced. A film camera works just like a digital camera nowadays except that there is a light sensitive film at the back of the camera that is momentarily exposed to light through the lens causing the chemicals on the film to react. Then, the film is processed in a so-called darkroom. In short, the film is put into an acidic solution (called the developer), then neutralized in another solution (called the stop bath), and made permanent in a chemical solution known as the fixer (Woodford, Chris). After the negative is created through this process, then the colors are inversed to create the positive print on to a photograph paper using an enlarger. Now, most people have a photo lab do this tedious process for them because they do not have the proper equipment or time to do this. These photo labs would do the exact same process on many photos from many different people at a time; therefore, creating the same effect on each photo. This is akin to the auto mode on digital cameras today because it is a similar algorithm that processes the photo in camera across all cameras. However, the enthusiastic film photographers, who wanted to stand out of the crowd of “auto” processed films, developed their own film. Therefore, they were in charge of the time their film spent developing in the chemicals or the temperature of the liquids. This article that was published through the University of Vermont states for longer or higher temperatures when developing film, “the more silver halide crystals that will be converted to metallic silver and the denser and darker the negative will be” (How Chemicals). This gives a good insight on who slight temperature changes in the liquid or slight time in the chemicals could change the contrast, highlights, blacks, etc. of the photo. These more advanced film photographers took advantage of these chemical properties to create a different style of “processing” photos. This was the beginning to post-processing photos. One unique and popular style of processing film involved swapping the chemicals in the develop process. Typically, color negative film uses a chemical called C-41 to process it and color slide film uses E-6 chemicals to process it. However, many photographers reversed the uses by using C-41 to process color slide film and E-6 to process color negative film which is called cross-processing (What the Hell Is). This reproduced different color tones on the photo than people were typical of seeing.</p>

         <p>The above photo is a normally edited photo, and the below photo shows the cross-processing effect. This photo was actually taken using a digital camera (opposed to a film camera). The cross-processing effect was created in Adobe Lightroom CC, but it still shows the point how film photographers tried to process their photos to be unique and different. This photo was taken by Nathaniel Young.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix colelem" id="u221-12"><!-- content -->
         <p><span id="u221">Another popular type of processing film actually is by using different types of film. This different film strips captured different colors slightly better or more saturated colors or greater contrast depending on the style the photographer was going for. There were different types of film including ones for more vibrant colors for landscapes or more true to life skin tones for portraits. Although these were not done in post-processing, it still shaped the way photographers edit their photos today. Cross-processing, different photographic film types, and many other things done by film photographers would eventually set the stage for how photos are digitally manipulated.</span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;Film photography eventually paved the way for digital photography. The first digital camera was created in the 1970s, but this idea of digital photographs did not really take off until the 1990s when digital cameras became more available for the general consumer market (Trenholm, Richard). Also in 1990, the Adobe Photoshop 1.0 was released. This pixel based color editor was the first piece of software of its kind, and quickly gained attention from artists and photographers alike. Photoshop soon became the image editing standard because of its powerful tools and ease of access to the general public. The first versions of Photoshop ran on the Macintosh computer by Apple; since this was a mass marketed consumer based computer, many people instantly had access to this new piece of software. It only became a matter of time before photographers realized the power of digital photography and switched from film. Rob Wood, who is an online author and photographer, stated that Photoshop “has basically replaced the darkroom as the modern way in which photographers tweak their imagery” (Wood, Rob). I fully agree that this piece of software became a way for photographers to make the transition to digital photography without losing their creative processing techniques. However, this digital age that brought new digital cameras and powerful editing software did not fundamentally change how photographers manipulated their photos; it just gave access to many photographers because it instantly became much more widely available. Today, the camera still fundamentally works the same except with a digital sensor, and photographers still manipulate and process their photos in a similar fashion. But now, these tools have expanded the possibilities of the photographer which brings up ethical questions of abusing the power.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;Today, the most popular photo editors are unsurprisingly Adobe Photoshop and its little brother Adobe Lightroom. There are a vase number of other photo editors, but Adobe has a very strong hold on this market. Lightroom is a raw photo editor with organization features and Photoshop is used for more extensive retouching, masking, faking, etc. Many people have abused the power of these pieces of software in Photography, and now “Photoshop” has become a well-recognized verb. I believe that post-processing a photograph is perfectly fine, and it expresses the feelings, atmosphere, emotion, location, and style that the photographer wanted to capture. However, I do believe that there is a point where too much editing is not okay.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;To start, all the basic adjustments to exposure, contrast, curves, and color temperature are almost all agreed upon in the community of photographers as perfectly fine. These changes all appear natural and normal to the human eye, and thus appear real. These settings can be used to correct for the camera exposure settings (shutter speed, ISO, and aperture) so that the photo is not over or under exposed. These are all changes that would make sense which can be replicated in real life. This makes photography more practical and less time-consuming knowing that if your camera’s exposure was slightly off, that it can easily be fixed in software. Here is an example of a photo I took with minor edits:</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>

         <p>The above photo is the unedited photo, and the below photo is the fully edited raw file. In this photo that I took in London of Big Ben, I only made minor adjustments to the basic exposure, contrast, highlights, and shadows. In my opinion, this is a very mild edit, and perfectly acceptable in the photography community. This photo was taken by Nathaniel Young.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix colelem" id="u250-4"><!-- content -->
         <p><span id="u250">Nasim Mansurov, who is a professional photographer based out of Denver and recognized as a leading educator in digital photography, said that he supports many types of post-processing “as long as it looks natural at the end” (Mansurov, Nasim). The problem is that what is considered natural. I believe that making color adjustments, removing camera spots or dust, creating local adjustments, bringing up the shadows, and using split toning are all acceptable things to do. These are all part of the tools that I believe a photographer can use to create their own style. This is why photography is as much of an art form as it is a way of documenting a moment in time. Since it is an art form, it is really mostly up to the photographer to decide what is acceptable to them. The problem is whatever looks okay and natural to one photographer may be too much processing for another. An astrophotographer Jeryy Lodriguss brings up a good point that “when we take a picture we do not make a perfectly objective recording of reality. What we make is an interpretation of reality” (Lodriguss, Jerry). Every photographer sees the world not only through the camera lens, but through his/her eyes. There is no right way or view of how the world should be captured; therefore, it is up to the photographer to determine how to capture it. This not only includes how to frame and exposure the shot, but also whether the colors should look nice and vibrant or desaturated and muted. Color is a very subjective thing because it is about how the photographer’s mind’s eye sees the colors in the composition which can be completely different from another person. That is why different color correcting styles by different photographers are so unique. This all depends on the atmosphere, mood, and feelings the photographer wants to evoke through his/her photograph.</span></p>

         <p>The above photo is the unedited photo, and the below photo is the fully edited raw file. This photo taken in the Hong Kong streets shows quite a bit more editing, and maybe even more than the average photographer is use to. However, the most major thing I did was change the temperature of the photo from being relatively warm with yellow lights to a more futuristic cool color tone with hints of purple. Along with all the basic exposure and contrast edits, I also edited some curves as well as minor split toning. This photo was taken by Nathaniel Young.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="clearfix colelem" id="u282-10"><!-- content -->
         <p><span id="u282">Don Norris, a photographer from California that moved to Australia and is the founder of Australia’s most popular surfing website, stated that there are some genres of photography where “a high level of manipulation aimed at producing perfection has long been the general practice” which includes fashion and product photography. Even though it has been traditionally known that these fields of photography have a high level of post-processing, I think everything is okay until that photographer distorts reality by for example, changing the body appearance of a person. In certain fields of photography, like journalism, the rules are must stricter. Journalism photography is much stricter because it plays an important role in documenting history. The New York Times writer, David Campbell, argues that crushing the black levels or cropping a photograph is breaking the ethics of photography because these can hide or get rid of something that was captured (Campbell, David). This is a very extreme view of photography, and even in photo journalism, I still believe a photographer can have a certain style to their photographs. And certainly changing the black levels to increase the overall photo’s contrast is entirely okay. Also, I believe that cropping a photo is perfectly okay especially to create a better composition, but in photo journalism, it can be seen as cutting out something. Therefore, as long as the subject of the photo stays the same, and nothing important is cut out of the photo (including masking) in this context of journalism, then I think it is okay.</span></p>
         <p>Finally, digital compositions from multiple photographs from different locations is generally not accepted within this photography community. There is a time and place for digital compositions in Photoshop (which is how Photoshop became a verb), but it is not inside the community of photography. Digital manipulations express and create something that was explicitly not possible in real life, and try to create a fantasy photo. These digital compositions definitely are accepted and are very popular in the art community.</p>
         <p>Photographers will always continue to post-process their photographs whether other people are against it or not. The motivation for a photographer to continue to edit their photos will always be to improve their photo to be the best it can be while distinguishing themselves from the crowd of other photographers. It will always be a blurred line between the aesthetics of a photo and the ethics of editing it. Every photographer wants their image to be aesthetically pleasing, and since there is no technical limit to what can be done to a photo, there will always be an ethically boundary. This will always continue to be an on going issue because people will continue to abuse the power of Photoshop in photography. However, since the amount of post-processing on a photo is all subjective to the photographer, this issue will almost certainly never be solved. Every photographer is going to see and depict a scene slightly differently, and that is why so many people are drawn to this diverse community for inspiration and to inspire.</p>
