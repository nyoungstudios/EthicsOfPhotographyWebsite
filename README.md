# Ethics of Photography Website
This website for my English paper about the ethics of photography. This is the github repository that was supposed to have the dns set up with domain.com, but it is not working.

If you want to use my essay article as a source, just make sure to cite it appropriately.

All photos are taken by me (Nathaniel Young) and can be viewed on my various social media accounts at @nyoungstudios. Here is my portfolio link: https://500px.com/nyoungstudios
